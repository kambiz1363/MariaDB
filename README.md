# MariaDB
## What is MariaDB
MariaDB is a relational database management system. It stores data in various tables. Primary keys and foreign keys are used to establish relationship between these tables.
MarinaDB provides the following features:
* RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) facilitates you to implement a data source with tables, columns, and indices.
* RDBMS provides integrity of references across rows of multiple tables.
* It is used to automatically update indices.
* It is used to interpret SQL queries and operations in manipulating or sourcing data from tables.
### Terms used in RDBMS
Following is a list of terms used in relational database management systems i.e. MariaDB :

**Database**: A database is a data store which contains table and holds related data.

**Table**: A table is a matrix like structure which contains data.

**Column**: A column is s data element. It is a structure which holds same type of data. For example name.

**Row**: A row is a structure which stores related data. For example: data for a customer. It is also known as a tuple, entry, or record.

**Redundancy**: The term redundancy specifies how to store data twice in order to accelerate the system.

**Primary Key**: Primary key is a unique identifying value. This value cannot appear twice within a table, and there is only one row associated with it.

**Foreign Key**: A foreign key is used as a a link between two tables.

**Compound Key**: A compound key, or composite key, is a key that refers to multiple columns. It refers to multiple columns due to a column lacking a unique quality.

**Index**: An index is virtually identical to the index of a book.

**Referential Integrity**: This term refers to ensuring all foreign key values point to existing rows.

 ### Features of MariaDB

MariaDB provides the same features of MySQL with some extensions. It is relatively new and advance.
Following is a list of features of MariaDB:

* MariaDB is licenced under GPL, LGPL, or BSD.
* MariaDB includes a wide selection of storage engines, including high-performance storage engines, for working with other RDBMS data sources.
* MariaDB uses a standard and popular querying language.
* MariaDB runs on a number of operating systems and supports a wide variety of programming languages.
* MariaDB offers support for PHP, one of the most popular web development languages.
* MariaDB offers Galera cluster technology.
* MariaDB also offers many operations and commands unavailable in MySQL, and eliminates/replaces features impacting performance negatively.
